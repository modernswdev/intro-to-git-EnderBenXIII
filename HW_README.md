# Intro to Git HW Assignment

Hello! My name is Benjamin Weisenfelder, but I just go by Ben. In this course I'm interested in learning how databases work and evolve, and how I can apply that to real-life work experience. A little about me: My favorite hobby is gaming, either solo or with friends. I enjoy all sorts of games of many varieties, and I'm the President of the UALR Gaming/eSports club!
